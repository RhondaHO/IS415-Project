## Project Motivation

Many prospective HDB buyers struggle to visualize and understand the amenities and facilities available in the vicinity of their desired location, often having to resort to manual searches on platforms like Google to determine the location of specific types of amenities. Additionally, current mapping tools do not provide a comprehensive and tailored view of amenities specific to HDBs. Our motivation is to simplify this process and make it easier for HDB buyers to view and understand the surrounding amenities through our analytical app. By providing a customized view of amenities relevant to HDB buyers, utilizing spatial point pattern analysis to visualize their distribution and clustering, and offering a user-friendly interface, we aim to help HDB buyers make more informed decisions about their purchases and feel more confident in their chosen residence.

## Project Objectives

This study seeks to gather crucial data that one might need to analyse and visualise to perform spatial point pattern analysis to:

1.  Estimate the intensity of HDB locations and amenities across the study area using Kernel Density Estimation.

2.  Determine whether the distribution of amenities around HDBs is random or clustered, and calculate the ratio of observed to expected nearest neighbor distances using F-Function analysis.

3.  Measure the degree of clustering or dispersion of HDB locations and surrounding amenities using Ripley's K-function and L-function analysis.

4.  Quantify the extent of spatial association and heterogeneity between HDB locations and surrounding amenities using Colocation Quotients (CLQs) analysis.

5.  Conduct Network Constrained Spatial Point Patterns Analysis to analyze the spatial distribution of HDB flats over a street network.

By achieving these objectives, our study aims to gain insights into the spatial distribution of HDB and amenities across the study area, identify significant spatial patterns and trends, and help inform planning and policy decisions related to urban development and resource allocation.

## Literature Review

#### #1: Spatial Point Pattern Analysis of Human Settlements and Geographical Associations in Eastern Coastal China - A Case Study [(Zhang et al., 2014)](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/11/3/2818) {.review}

This article highlights the potential of spatial point pattern analysis as a tool for gaining insights into the spatial patterns and associations of human settlements in rapidly urbanising regions. The article used spatial point pattern analysis techniques such as Ripley's K-function and nearest neighbour analysis, to analyse the spatial distribution and clustering of human settlements in eastern coastal China. Based on their results, it demonstrates the importance of considering spatial relationships and locational factors in understanding settlement patterns and provides insights that can be used to inform urban planning and development policies.

##### How does it link to our project?

To examine the spatial distribution and clustering of HDB locations and facilities in Singapore. We plan to use the following functions referenced from the article:

1.  Kernel density estimation: To identify areas with high or low concentrations of HDB locations or facilities, and to explore the relationship between HDB locations and surrounding amenities.

2.  Ripley's K-function: To measure the degree of spatial clustering or dispersion of point locations, which can help identify hotspots or coldspots of HDB locations or facilities and compare the observed spatial distribution of HDB locations or facilities to a random distribution, and test whether the observed pattern is statistically significant.

#### #2: Analysing the global and local spatial associations of medical resources across Wuhan city using POI data [(Chen, Q et al., 2023)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12913-023-09051-0)

This article highlights the issue of imbalance in the supply and demand of medical resources in provincial capitals of China and emphasises the need to understand the spatial patterns of medical resources to ensure fair and optimal allocation of limited resources. This article utilises the Localised Colocation Quotient (LCLQ) analysis, which is a technique that measures directional spatial associations and heterogeneity between categorical point data. By employing this method and utilising point of interest (POI) data, the study presents a unique analysis of the spatial patterns and directional spatial associations between six medical resources in Wuhan city.

##### How does it link to our project?

For our project, we need to first define the two types of features of interest which will be HDB locations and the presence of certain amenities. Some examples are schools, carparks, shopping centres and MRT stations. By comparing the observed and expected frequencies of co-occurrence using the LCLQ, we can determine whether HDB locations and surrounding amenities are spatially associated in a non-random way. This can provide insights into the degree to which the availability of amenities in an area affects HDB locations, and vice versa.

## Our Approach

1.  Data Preparation

    -   Assemble data from various sources

    -   Data handling and wrangling

2.  Exploratory Data Analysis

    -   Analyse the spatial arrangement of data points

    -   Identify any outliers or anomalies in the data sets

    -   Choropleth Mapping

3.  Spatial Point Patterns Analysis (Filter by: Sub-district/Region)

    1.  First point Analysis

        1.  Kernel Density Estimation:

    2.  Second point Analysis

        1.  F-Function: Identify whether the distribution of amenities around HDBs is random or clustered, and the ratio of observed to expected nearest neighbor distances.

        2.  Ripley's K-function and L function: To measure the degree of clustering or dispersion of HDB locations and surrounding amenities, and help identify significant spatial patterns and trends.

        3.  Colocation Quotients CLQs: To measure the extent of spatial association and heterogeneity between HDB locations and surrounding amenities, helping to identify areas of high or low co-location.

        4.  Network Constrained Spatial Point Patterns Analysis: To analyse the spatial distribution of HDB flats over a street network
