With all of that in mind, one must still maintain track of a list of prospective options, the facilities around the premises, and the ease of it in order to forecast its future potential. As a result, integrating pricing, circumstances surrounding properties, and displaying it geopolitically might alleviate key concerns for purchasers and assist them in making informed judgments."

    "text": "Literature Review\n\n#1: Spatial Point Pattern Analysis of Human Settlements and Geographical Associations in Eastern Coastal China - A Case Study (Zhang et al., 2014)\nThis article highlights the potential of spatial point pattern analysis as a tool for gaining insights into the spatial patterns and associations of human settlements in rapidly urbanising regions. The article used spatial point pattern analysis techniques such as Ripley‚Äôs K-function and nearest neighbour analysis, to analyse the spatial distribution and clustering of human settlements in eastern coastal China. Based on their results, it demonstrates the importance of considering spatial relationships and locational factors in understanding settlement patterns and provides insights that can be used to inform urban planning and development policies.\n\nHow does it link to our project?\nTo examine the spatial distribution and clustering of HDB locations and facilities in Singapore. We plan to use the following functions referenced from the article:\n\nKernel density estimation: To identify areas with high or low concentrations of HDB locations or facilities, and to explore the relationship between HDB locations and surrounding amenities.\nRipley‚Äôs K-function: To measure the degree of spatial clustering or dispersion of point locations, which can help identify hotspots or coldspots of HDB locations or facilities and compare the observed spatial distribution of HDB locations or facilities to a random distribution, and test whether the observed pattern is statistically significant.\n\n\n\n\n#2: Analysing the global and local spatial associations of medical resources across Wuhan city using POI data (Chen, Q et al., 2023)\nThis article highlights the issue of imbalance in the supply and demand of medical resources in provincial capitals of China and emphasises the need to understand the spatial patterns of medical resources to ensure fair and optimal allocation of limited resources. This article utilises the Localised Colocation Quotient (LCLQ) analysis, which is a technique that measures directional spatial associations and heterogeneity between categorical point data. By employing this method and utilising point of interest (POI) data, the study presents a unique analysis of the spatial patterns and directional spatial associations between six medical resources in Wuhan city.\n\nHow does it link to our project?\nFor our project, we need to first define the two types of features of interest which will be HDB locations and the presence of certain amenities. Some examples are schools, carparks, shopping centres and MRT stations. By comparing the observed and expected frequencies of co-occurrence using the LCLQ, we can determine whether HDB locations and surrounding amenities are spatially associated in a non-random way. This can provide insights into the degree to which the availability of amenities in an area affects HDB locations, and vice versa."
