    "text": "Project Objectives\nReal estate companies, property developers, and individuals looking to buy properties find it hard to have a comprehensive understanding of the prices and the ideal location. They desperately seek to have the information that will help to identify areas with high potential for growth and investment, or to determine the impact of new developments on their property values. There is now a lot of data accessible, but it is not as meaningful as individual components. For example, property values are not presented by geographical location. Similarly, other elements that have a significant influence on house prices, such as amenities like car parks, school and shopping malls are additional factors about which one should obtain information each time they locate a suitable property.\nWith that being said, this study seeks to gather crucial data that one might need to analyse and perform spatial point pattern analysis to:\n\nDetermine the spatial distribution of HDB prices and the presence of amenities across the study area.\nIdentify significant spatial clustering or dispersion of HDB prices and amenities.\nIdentify areas of the study area where certain amenities may be lacking or are in high demand, which can inform planning and policy decisions related to urban development and resource allocation.\n\nIn conclusion, geospatial analysis of housing prices and variables influencing housing prices is critical because it offers a more complete insight of the property‚Äôs future possibilities, and may assist stakeholders in making better educated decisions based on local, geographical considerations."

    "text": "Literature Review\n\n#1: Spatial Point Pattern Analysis of Human Settlements and Geographical Associations in Eastern Coastal China - A Case Study (Zhang et al., 2014)\nThis article highlights the potential of spatial point pattern analysis as a tool for gaining insights into the spatial patterns and associations of human settlements in rapidly urbanising regions. The article used spatial point pattern analysis techniques such as Ripley‚Äôs K-function and nearest neighbour analysis, to analyse the spatial distribution and clustering of human settlements in eastern coastal China. Based on their results, it demonstrates the importance of considering spatial relationships and locational factors in understanding settlement patterns and provides insights that can be used to inform urban planning and development policies.\n\nHow does it link to our project?\nTo examine the spatial distribution and clustering of HDB prices and facilities in Singapore. We plan to use the following functions referenced from the article:\n\nKernel density estimation: To identify areas with high or low concentrations of HDB prices or facilities, and to explore the relationship between HDB prices and surrounding amenities.\nRipley‚Äôs K-function: To measure the degree of spatial clustering or dispersion of point locations, which can help identify hotspots or coldspots of HDB prices or facilities and compare the observed spatial distribution of HDB prices or facilities to a random distribution, and test whether the observed pattern is statistically significant.\n\n\n\n\n#2: Analysing the global and local spatial associations of medical resources across Wuhan city using POI data (Chen, Q et al., 2023)\nThis article highlights the issue of imbalance in the supply and demand of medical resources in provincial capitals of China and emphasises the need to understand the spatial patterns of medical resources to ensure fair and optimal allocation of limited resources. This article utilises the Localised Colocation Quotient (LCLQ) analysis, which is a technique that measures directional spatial associations and heterogeneity between categorical point data. By employing this method and utilising point of interest (POI) data, the study presents a unique analysis of the spatial patterns and directional spatial associations between six medical resources in Wuhan city.\n\nHow does it link to our project?\nFor our project, we need to first define the two types of features of interest which will be HDB prices and the presence of certain amenities. Some examples are schools, carparks, shopping centres and MRT stations. By comparing the observed and expected frequencies of co-occurrence using the LCLQ, we can determine whether HDB prices and surrounding amenities are spatially associated in a non-random way. This can provide insights into the degree to which the availability of amenities in an area affects HDB prices, and vice versa."
